# A proof of concept RESTful API using koa.js

I've created this repository to better understand REST architectural style using Node.js with a great help from Koa.js. The application consists of a simple blog platform where is possible to post articles and comments. I've tried my best to 
follow every REST constraint and the following sections describe what I've done 
to accomplish that.

* Uniform Interface
* Client Server
* Stateless
* Cachable
* Layered System

## Uniform Interface

## Client Server

## Stateless

## Cachable
